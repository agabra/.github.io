# Final Project Guideline

The final project is a major component of this course. Each group is expected to develop a digital-geographies related project. It can be a web map, a smart dashboard, a geo-narrative, or a project that has been approved by the instructor. To have a better idea of the course expectations, you can refer to the examples below:

-  Mapping the Black Lives Matter Movement: https://protestmap.raceandpolicing.com
-  COVID Care Map: https://www.covidcaremap.org/maps/us-healthcare-system-capacity
-  Marikina City: https://comet.dlsu.edu.ph/riesgo-vis
-  Mutual Aid Network: https://www.mutualaidhub.org/
-  Map of direct-to-consumer brands based in NYC: https://air.inc/blog/supportnycdtc
-  Connectivity Disparity Across Schools in Kazakhstan: https://unicef.github.io/mapbox_analysis/story/map
-  Restaurant Complaints in NYC: https://labs.mapbox.com/bites/00304/
-  Flow Map: https://flowmap.blue/


## Requirement

All the final projects are expected to be published online, and the codes are expected to be shared on GitHub in order to contribute to both the open-source community and academia. The final project must satisfy the following items:

- Host your project on github. By doing so, your project can be visited via a url link such as `[username].github.io/[repo_name]`.

- In addition to the main feature of the digital-geographies (e.g. web map, smart dashboard, or geo-narrative), you should also show the project title, a short description, legend, data sources, and acknowledgment at easily found places on the web page.

- A `readme.md` describes your web map, including, but not limited to,
    - Project title
    - Project description
    - Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?)
    - Data sources
    - Applied libraries (e.g., Mapbox, D3, C3) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use
    - Other things that are necessary to inform the audience.
    - Acknowledgment


## Timeline

Week 4: Brainstorm

Week 5: [Draft project proposal, data sources, and other multimedia](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1547729/discussion_topics/7237157) `Due: April 30, 11:59pm`

> Please share your final project proposal on this discussion board.  A proposal only needs to be shared once by one of your group members. In the proposal, please indicate what you want to make by the end of this quarter, the targeting audience,  the available datasets, the required multimedia (e.g., texts, images, videos, etc), and the functions. It would be great if you can find one or two digital geographies-related projects that you can learn from. It will give the instructor and TAs a better idea of how to help you.  The proposal needs to have **at least 300 words** and one or two screenshots of the available projects that you want to learn from. Once a project proposal is shared, I welcome any suggestions if you have, the TAs and the instructor will participate in the discussion too.

Week 6: [Design project prototype](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1547729/discussion_topics/7246492)  `Due: May 7, by 11:59pm`

> Please share your project prototype on this discussion board. A prototype is a sketch of your expected graphic user interface (GUI) of the project. Usually, it will contain a few GUIs of the proposed project. When designing the prototype, you are expected to first 1) determine what types of projects your group plan to work on: a general web map project, a storymap, or a dashboard; and then for each interface, you are expected to 2) appropriately illustrate each component (e.g., map view, title, legend, side panel, etc.) in its right size to its position on a web page. Please make sure 3) to balance the information richness and the legibility of the design. In other words, it should not be too complicated, but it can still illustrate adequate information about the project. You are encouraged to create the prototype by drawing on paper or designing on [Figma](https://www.figma.com) if you prefer.

Week 7: Project pilot study and proposal revision

Week 8: Proposal revision and project development

Week 9-10: Coding

Finals Week: Project presentation and submission

## Presentation

Academics often attend conferences where they share their discoveries and browse the work of others to gain new ideas and offer feedback. We will hold a final presentation meeting on **June 8th, 4:30 to 6:20 PM**, each group is expected to present the final project in 5 minutes, and plus another 2 minute for a Q&A session.

## Submission

To submit your final project, you will need to share the url link of your final project's GitHub repository to a dedicated final project submission tab on Canvas by June 8th, 11:59pm

>  **Note:** The requirements to the project may be slightly changed according the progress of this course. The final requirements are subject to the instructor's notification.
